    ## really need a way send multiple requests while still within API rate limits.
    ## right now, I'm doing 1pair of origin/destination per request.
    ## need 580 * 580 = 336400 based on my current setup.
    ## can cut this in half by adding some logic not to redo pairs that have been done.
    ## this is still a lot. 168200.
    ## even if I get 25 destination per request, that still leaves me with 6728 requests.
    ## but I have 2500 per day. I should be able to set this up so I just get all the data I need
    ## in three days. and probably store in csv or something so I don't have to get it again.
    ## before going ahead to implement this, I should probably think about interaction with the directions
    ## API and see if it's independent. if not, then i have to do that at same time in order to have data to
    ## to display directions info on the map.
    ## need to look into encoded polyline, maybe? or just put multiple destinations in request.
