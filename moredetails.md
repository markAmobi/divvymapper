## MVP
Users will simply be able to select a start station and an end station. After that, user simply sees a path on the map with some info about distance and duration.

### Post MVP

- Users can typein start and end points instead of being limited to divvy stations as point.
- path from start to end will include possible intermediate points with divvy stations. This will be helpful because of divvy's 30 minutes rule.
